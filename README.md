NAME
====

**Text::CSV::Simple** - A simple CSV file reader

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Text::CSV::Simple;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Text::CSV::Simple** is a very simple CSV file reader which is not very robust. It is intended as a makeshift CSV file reader for my use until module **Text::CSV::LibCSV** can be made to test successfully with **Github worklflows**.
